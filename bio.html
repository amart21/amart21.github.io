      <p>I grew up in the small town of Bryan, OH. And while farming, bailing hay, and hunting
        hunting are pasttimes some enjoy, I dreamt of big cities and excitement. Heading to Columbus, I 
        attended and graduated from The Ohio State University. Eager to start my career off with a bang, 
        I became a full commissioned mortgage broker. Learning the in's and out's of lending, I gradually 
        started to delve more and more into the regulatory side of banking. Going from Consumer Lending and underwriting
        with PNC, to mortgage and portfolio risk with Huntington came naturally. Ultimately, I grew into owning and 
        maintaining Huntington's CRE, Auto, Consumer Lending, and Other Consumer loan CCAR quarterly review processes. But over time,
        I gradually found myself gravitating towards a desire to learn how to code. It wasn't until the end of 2019 when I decided to
         "go all in", where I enrolled into We Can Code IT's 2020 Jave cohort.
