        <h2><a href="https://github.com/2020-Spring-Cohort/virtual-pets-amok-cfgi">Virtual Pets Amok</a></h2>
        <p>Terminal-based application simulating a pet shelter, with options to feed, play with, clean, and rescue organic and robotic pets. 
          Created as part of a team using agile methods and TDD.
        Used superclasses and subclasses to distinguish functions between robotic and organic pets, and to differentiate results between cats and dogs.</p>
        <br>
        <h2><a href="https://github.com/">High St Hospital</a></h2>
        <p>Terminal-based Java application using a group of hash maps to simulate a hospital with various staff members and patients.  
        Used superclasses and interfaces to enable doctors and nurses to perform the same tasks with different results, and to prevent janitors and other maintenance staff from providing medical support.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/WCCI-one-day-at-a-time/OneDayAtATime">One Day at a Time</a></h2>
        <p>
          Dynamic interactive website developed with pair programming, SCRUM, and Agile Methodologies. This project is the culmination of all the various
          aspects of software development I and the team learned in the WCCI program. This project incorporated test-driven development, Java, JavaScript, Rest API
          Postman, Console testing, HTML, CSS, and most importantly: teamwork. This app is customizable for a personal experience, and provides low, medium, and high 
          priority advice based on user input, and what feelings are marked. The app also allows for the individual to track their daily progress over a month's time, with 
          relavant data for a particular day tracked.
